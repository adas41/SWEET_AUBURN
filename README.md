This is achieved by the use of motion-maneuverable panoramic shots (virtual-tour) as wells as GPS guided actual tour of various POIs complete with contextual audio playback. 

The app operates in two modes - virtual and guided tour. The virtual tour uses Argon's Panorama rendering API to play gesture-maneuverable image content overlaid with informational text. The guided tour uses Google's Transit API to guide user from current location to the selected destination with route information and other contextual information overlaid on the real-world view experienced through Argon.
